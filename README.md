## The Problem

Every translation loses something. Ancient Greek has four words for "love"—*eros*, *philia*, *agape*, *storge*. English collapses them to one. Poetic meter vanishes. Puns disappear. You're reading an interpreter's choices, not the author's words.

**The solution?** Learn the original language.

## What This Is

The first comprehensive platform for learning **46 ancient languages** using modern AI—from Sumerian cuneiform (3100 BCE) to medieval manuscripts. Built on research-grade linguistic data (Perseus, LSJ, TLA Berlin, ORACC UPenn), not AI hallucinations.

**Not just Greek and Latin.** Humanity's full linguistic heritage—Indo-European, Semitic, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Mesoamerican, and more.

## Key Features

### 🎓 AI Lesson Generation

Generate exercises from authentic texts—not "The apple is red," but real passages from Homer, the *Ṛgveda*, and Pyramid Texts.

- **Alphabet drills** — Master Greek letters, Hebrew script, cuneiform, hieroglyphics
- **Vocabulary matching** — Context-based from real literature
- **Cloze exercises** — Fill-in-blank from authentic passages
- **Translation practice** — Ancient ↔ English with AI feedback

Target specific passages: "Generate lesson from *Iliad* 1.20-1.50"

### 📖 Interactive Reader

Tap any word for instant scholarly analysis. Currently available: Homer's *Iliad* with full Perseus morphological data.

```
Tap "Μῆνιν" (first word of the Iliad) →

Lemma: μῆνις
Morphology: Feminine accusative singular
LSJ: "wrath, anger, especially of the gods"
Grammar: Smyth §175 (Accusative of Respect)
Etymology: PIE *mē- ("anger")
```

Works offline—all linguistic data embedded.

### 💬 Conversational Practice

## Why This Matters

### For Language Learners

Learn ancient languages the way you'd learn Spanish in a modern language app—but with scholarly accuracy and authentic texts. No dry textbooks. No "The apple is red." Just real Homer, real Plato, real Vedas.

### For Scholars & Educators

Research-grade linguistic data meets modern UX. Instant morphological analysis and semantic search that would take hours with physical dictionaries. Perfect for teaching or research.

### For Developers

Showcase of AI-powered education done right. October 2025 LLM APIs, vector search with pgvector, multi-provider architecture, 173+ tests passing, professional development practices.

### For Humanity

Ancient languages are living connections to our ancestors. When they fade, we lose entire conceptual frameworks, rhetorical traditions, and direct access to primary sources. This platform reverses that loss.
