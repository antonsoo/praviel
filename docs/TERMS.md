# AncientLanguages — Supporter Terms (Donations & Memberships)
**Version:** 1.2
**Effective date:** 2025-10-16

> **Scope**: These Terms govern voluntary financial support for AncientLanguages—via one-time donations or recurring memberships—through Stripe, GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, Open Collective, Ko-fi, Liberapay, and cryptocurrency.
>
> **These Terms do NOT govern general app usage.** For general app terms, see [Terms of Use](TERMS_OF_USE.md) and [Data Use & Privacy Policy](DATA_POLICY.md).

## 1) Who we are
**Operator:** Anton Soloviev (sole proprietor), doing business as **“AncientLanguages.”**
**Project:** AncientLanguages — AI-assisted learning platform for ancient languages.
**Contact:** (antonnsoloviev@gmail.com) • Non-sensitive issues may be opened at https://github.com/antonsoo/AncientLanguages/issues

## 2) Scope
These Terms apply to your financial support made through the channels listed below (“Support”). By using any channel, you also agree to that platform’s own terms and policies.

## 3) Support channels
- **Stripe:** one-time or recurring cards/wallets (via our Payment Link).
- **GitHub Sponsors:** one-time or recurring sponsorships tied to your GitHub account.
- **Patreon:** recurring membership; we may offer **discretionary perks** (e.g., early access) via Patreon only.
- **Open Collective:** one-time or recurring; emphasizes transparent ledgers.
- **Ko-fi / Liberapay:** one-time or recurring contributions managed on those platforms.
- **Crypto (BTC/ETH/XMR):** on-chain transfers to addresses we publish.

## 4) Donations vs. memberships; perks
Support is **voluntary** and generally **without expectation of goods or services**. We may offer limited, discretionary perks on certain platforms (e.g., Patreon early access). Perks: (i) are **not equity** or ownership; (ii) may change or end at any time; (iii) are governed by the platform’s own features and policies; and (iv) are not guaranteed outside that platform.

## 5) Tax status
Unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing, Support for AncientLanguages is **not tax-deductible**. You are responsible for any tax implications in your jurisdiction.

## 6) Payments and processors
We use third-party processors/platforms (Stripe, GitHub, Patreon, Open Collective, Ko-fi, Liberapay, and crypto networks). We don’t store full card numbers. Each platform may share limited payment metadata with us for receipts, accounting, security, and fraud prevention.

## 7) Refunds, chargebacks, reversals
- **General:** Support is **final and non-refundable** to the maximum extent permitted by law.
- **Platform specifics:** Some platforms have their own refund tooling or cooling-off rules; if applicable, they control the outcome.
- **Crypto:** **Irreversible by design.** We cannot recover funds sent to a wrong address, unsupported network, or with insufficient fees.

## 8) Recurring billing and cancellation
You can cancel future charges at any time **on the same platform** you used:
- **Stripe:** use the “manage billing” link in receipts or contact us before renewal.
- **GitHub Sponsors:** GitHub → “Sponsoring” settings.
- **Patreon:** Patreon → “Manage Memberships.”
- **Open Collective:** your profile → “Subscriptions.”
- **Ko-fi / Liberapay:** your account settings on those services.
Cancellations apply prospectively; past charges aren’t refunded unless a platform’s policy mandates it.

## 9) Use of funds
Support helps cover engineering time, hosting/compute, data curation, security, documentation, and related operational costs for AncientLanguages. Allocation is at our discretion.

## 10) AML, sanctions, and unlawful activity
You agree not to use Support channels to launder funds, evade sanctions, or finance unlawful activity. We may refuse or return (where feasible) funds we suspect are unlawful or restricted. For crypto, we may decline to acknowledge transfers flagged by risk screening.

## 11) Privacy
See the **Privacy Policy (Donations & Memberships)** for how we handle personal data and which processors are involved. Each platform also processes data under its own privacy policy.

## 12) Intellectual property
“AncientLanguages,” our logos, code, and content are protected by IP laws. These Terms grant **no** license except to view our pages and use Support channels.

## 13) Disclaimers
Support pages and the project are provided **“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.”** We disclaim all warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee uptime, feature delivery, or outcomes.

## 14) Limitation of liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages. Our aggregate liability relating to your Support will not exceed the total amount you contributed in the **twelve (12) months** before the event giving rise to the claim.

## 15) Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from losses, liabilities, claims, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from (i) your breach of these Terms or (ii) your misuse of the Support channels.

## 16) Changes to these Terms
We may update these Terms at any time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the **Effective date**. Continued use of Support channels after changes constitutes acceptance.

## 17) Governing law and venue
These Terms are governed by the laws of **[Your U.S. state]** and the **United States**, excluding conflict-of-law rules. Disputes will be resolved in the courts located in **[Your city/state]**, unless applicable consumer law requires otherwise.

## 18) Severability; assignment; entire agreement
If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. We may assign these Terms; you may not assign them without our prior written consent. These Terms constitute the entire agreement regarding Support.
