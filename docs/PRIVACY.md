# PRAVIEL — Privacy Policy (Donations & Memberships)
**Version:** 1.2
**Effective date:** 2025-10-16

## 1) Scope
**This policy covers personal data related to financial support only** (donations and memberships via Stripe, GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, Open Collective, Ko-fi, Liberapay, or cryptocurrency).

**For general app usage, see [Data Use & Privacy Policy](DATA_POLICY.md).**

## 2) Data we collect
- **You provide:** email, display name/username (varies by platform), amount, currency, frequency (one-time/recurring), optional notes.
- **From platforms/processors:** limited payment metadata (e.g., transaction IDs, card brand & last 4 for card payments, status/failure codes, timestamps), and your platform handle/ID. We do **not** receive or store full card numbers.
- **Crypto:** sending address, receiving address we publish, transaction hash, amount, time, and any memo/tag (public blockchain data).

## 3) Processors and platforms
We rely on third parties to process payments and manage memberships: **Stripe**, **GitHub (Sponsors)**, **Patreon**, **Open Collective**, **Ko-fi**, **Liberapay**, and public **blockchain networks** for crypto. They process data under their own terms and privacy policies.

## 4) Purposes of use
- Issue receipts/confirmations and manage recurring billing.
- Reconcile accounts; comply with tax and accounting obligations.
- Prevent fraud/abuse; defend against chargebacks and disputes.
- Communicate about your support or account issues.
- Produce aggregate, non-identifying analytics (e.g., number of donors per month).

## 5) Legal bases (EU/UK where applicable)
- **Contract / Legitimate interests:** process support, operate and secure the service.
- **Legal obligation:** retain transaction records.
- **Consent:** optional marketing communications (only if you explicitly opt in).

## 6) Sharing
- With the platforms and processors listed above.
- With service providers for bookkeeping, storage, email, and security—bound by confidentiality and data-processing terms.
- With authorities where required by law.
We **do not sell** personal data.

## 7) Retention
We retain transaction records and related personal data as needed for legal, accounting, and operational purposes (typically **7–10 years** for financial records, depending on jurisdiction). Blockchain records are public and persistent.

## 8) International transfers
Platforms and processors may store or process data globally. Where required, transfers rely on safeguards such as SCCs, adequacy decisions, or equivalent mechanisms used by those providers.

## 9) Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risks of handling supporter data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 10) Your rights
Subject to local laws, you can request access, correction, deletion, or portability; object to or restrict processing; and withdraw consent (for any optional marketing) at any time. We may need to retain certain records for legal reasons even after a deletion request.

## 11) Children
Support channels are not directed to children under 13 (or the relevant minimum age). Do not submit children’s personal data.

## 12) Contact
**Data controller:** Anton Soloviev (sole proprietor), “PRAVIEL.”
**Email:** (support@praviel.com). For non-sensitive matters, you may open an issue at https://github.com/antonsoo/praviel/issues.

## 13) Changes
We may update this policy. The **Effective date** will change, and the new policy applies from publication.
